Starting a New Project
======================

There are several steps to create a new Marketplace frontend project.

First, clone the `Marketplace Template <https://github.com/mozilla/marketplace-template>`_.
This will be the base of your project. Set up your Git configs to point this
project towards your new project's remote.
